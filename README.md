# A simple Project Management App with CRUD functionality built with GraphQL

## WHY

This project was built to practice and solidify my understanding of some libraries/tools. They include but not limited to:
- `TypeScript`
- `GraphQL`
- `ChakraUI`
- `NodeJS`
- `Express`
- `MongoDB`
- `Mongoose`
- `ApolloClient`

As a frontend specialised dev, this project was an expose to backend and databases.\
Next is hosting this repo as a FullStack app. I'll update this readme as soon as that is accomplished.

Coming back to this project 6 months later, I added google signIn and authentication to the backend.
The app can work with anonymous users and loggedIn users. Carried out some research for authentication with GraphQL.
It's been quite a ride

## Available Scripts

In the sever directory, you can run:

### `npm dev`

Runs the server in the development mode on PORT **5000** except if specified in env.\
Open [http://localhost:5000/graphql](http://localhost:5000/graphql) to open a GUI interface to interact with the server on a browser.\
The page will reload if you make edits.\

Use this in production.\
